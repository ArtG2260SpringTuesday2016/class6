- Functions should do one thing.
- "magic numbers" are bad
  - Magic Number (n) A number that just magically seems to make things work
- Not a bad idea to separate out every data manipulation
  - Go from JSON to an array with the first two items to an array with totals
    JSON > Array with only the first two items > Array with totals
- What should be in setup, what should be in draw?
- Can you keep variables at their most specific scope?
- Are you repeating operations?
- If read your program later will it readily make sense?
- Are things named well?
- Is your file easy to navigate? (Is there lots of unnecessary scrolling?)
- Is the project?


### Bonus
- Can you save on repeated operations (caching variables ahead of time)
